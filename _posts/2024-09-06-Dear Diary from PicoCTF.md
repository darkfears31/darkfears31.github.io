So add the disk file to `autopsy`. Then Go to `keyword search`and search for `.txt`files and see all the `file.txt`, after that you will get the flag.![](/assets/images/Screenshot from 2024-07-19 15-23-26.png)
Skip all the `5` that stands alone that has nothing to do with the flag:
**picoCTF{1_533_n4m35_80d24b30}**
