>Hints
>What are streams?

From hints i knew that i should've searched trough streams.
I opened file and immediately saw that there was three types of packets: **TCP, UDP and ARP**.
ARP has no stream but TCP and UDP has.
So let's search trough TCP and UDP streams.

There is nothing in TCP streams so now let's go trough UDP streams.
