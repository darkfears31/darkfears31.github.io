>Hints
>Experiment with different shell syntax

In this SSH environment i can't use normal commands like `nano cd ls` etc. 
I'm not that knowledgeable so i had to search up the answer and i came across this:
```
${parameter=<command>}
```
The syntax `${parameter=ls}` is specific to the **Z Shell (zsh)** and can be a bit misleading if taken out of context. This syntax is used for parameter expansion with assignment, where the `parameter` is assigned the output of the `ls` command if it is not already set.
So this means that `parameter`is not assigned anywhere so it takes `<command>`as an argument and `$` calls it and it shows the answers.
```
Special$ ${parameter=ls}
${parameter=ls} 
blargh
Special$ ${parameter=cd blargh}
${parameter=cd blargh}
${parameter=cat blargh/flag.txt} 
picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_0c61d335}
```
Here we go The flag is:
**picoCTF{5p311ch3ck_15_7h3_w0r57_0c61d335}**
