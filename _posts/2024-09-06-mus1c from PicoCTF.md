[page](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/15?difficulty=2&page=10&search=&solved=0)
> Description
I wrote you aÂ [song](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/c594d8d915de0129d92b4c41e25a2313/lyrics.txt). Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

>Hints
>Do you think you can master rockstar?

I downloaded the file and i got this:

```
Pico's a CTFFFFFFF

Put my mind of Pico into This

It's music text. From Hints i thought i could get something, i searched "master rockstar" and i got this site [codewithrockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/online) i entered the text and got the decimal encrypted text:
```

I went to [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Decimal('Line%20feed',false)) , Entered this decimals and got this: 
>rrrocknrn0113r

Wrapped it with picoCTF{} and got the flag:
**picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}**
